========== OpenTibia Server 0.6.3 ==========

============================================


What is this?
	OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
	based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

How does it work?
	In the past OTServ could be played on Tibia 7.1, 7.11, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.61, 7.7, 7.71, 
	7.8, 7.81, ,7.82, 7.9, 7.92, 8.0, 8.1, 8.11, 8.2 ,8.21, 8.22, 8.3, 8.4, 8.41, 8.42, 8.5, 
	8.51, 8.52, 8.53, 8.54, 8.55, 8.56, 8.57.
	
	OTServ is now played using Tibia 8.60 and 8.61.

	To connect Tibia client to OTServ you will have to use an IP changer, you can get one here
	http://www.otchanger.net/

	Once that's done, start the OTServ up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. 
	
	You have to execute some sql queries from schema.mysql, schema.pgsql or even schema.sqlite.
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config.lua

	NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.
