How do I compile OTServ?
	OTServ stores accounts, players and some other tabelar info within relational database. It is very reliable
	way which also provides huge possibilities of easy data management and manipulation. By default SQLite is
	selected as database engine. It doesn't require any configuration from you, OTServ is configured for it by default and all what you need is to provide SQLite library for it.

MySQL Server
	By default OTServ uses SQLite database which doesn't require any configuration from you. However it is
	possible to use MySQL database instead of SQLite - MySQL is more powerful database system which is
	faster, more reliable and gives more possibilities. However MySQL is uses client-server structure which
	means you will need MySQL server for it.


		Instructions to setup a server:
			1. Download XAMPP (not XAMPP Lite) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.7.4/xampp-win32-1.7.4-VC6-installer.exe/download)
			2. Install
			3. Open "xampp-control.exe"
			4. Click on the buttons Start to open "MySQL" and "Apache"
			5. Go on your browser and type in the address bar "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
			6. Find the name "phpmyadmin" and go to it
			7. You will find some controls, make a database called "otserv"
			8. Now you will be taken to the database, click the tab "SQL"
			9. Goto the file named schema.mysql, its in the folder this README is in.
			10.	Copy the text in that file and paste it in that text box on your browser then press ok ;)
			11. Now go to your folder and open config.lua and make sure the SQL Stuff there is correct such as the mysql user and password ;).
				Should be all correct for you anyway ;).
			12. Start the server and login using tibia/tibia.

			
What about old XML files?
	If you have your old database in XML format and want to switch to SQL database, there is XML2SQL project in our SVN tree.

Different name on configuration file
	Default configuration file for OTServ is config.lua. In some cases you might need to use another name for 
	it as config.lua might be ambiguous. OTServ can use otserv.lua file instead of config.lua file.

		Instructions to compile OTServ to use otserv.lua config file:
			a) On Windows use -D__LUA_NAME_ALTER__
			b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --with-otconfig
			
		Instructions to compile OTServ with SQLite and other drivers:
			1. Download SQLite libraries from http://sqlite.org/download.html (or just install them from packages in your Linux distro).
			2. Compile your OTServ against SQLite:
				a) On Windows use -D__USE_SQLITE__ -lsqlite3 -D__USE_MYSQL__ -lmysqlclient
				b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --enable-sqlite or ./configure --enable-mysql

			
Problems?
	The server is stable now-a-days, but if you do find bugs, you can report them at the 
	OpenTibia Project Tools forum at OTFans (http://otfans.net/project.php?projectid=1). When the
	server crashes, you should get a report generated at your Otserv folder named report.txt, 
	you should also report this at the Project Tools forum, this report will help us in resolving the bugs.
