keywordHandler:addKeyword({'job'}, StdModule.say, {npcHandler = npcHandler, onlyFocus = true, text = 'I am the librarian in this place. I don\'t like the work too much because we do not really have that many books, and most of them are written by people who have died thousands of years ago. ...'})

keywordHandler:addKeyword({'alesar'}, StdModule.say, {npcHandler = npcHandler, onlyFocus = true, text = 'I have never known this djinn, but apparently there is some sad story behind this.

Most of them are technical documents written by uncle Fad at some point or other. Now and then he turns up and brings new files. Not that anybody would ever re'})
